## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Fetch API
- Rubik (Google Fonts)

### What I learned

This project refreshed my memory on how to get and display data from an API. even though this was a dummy data from a local .json file, the principles are still the same and have helped me in other projects where I had to integrate an API and get data from it. So it's a nice refresher.

### Continued development

There is always room for improvements and what I want to do is to keep on working with API's until it becomes like writing HTML code for me, so I'm taking on more nd more projects where I have to consume an API's
